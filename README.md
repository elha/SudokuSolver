# SudokuSolver Project
Welcome to my SudokuSolver project on Github! This project is a simple sudoku solver that uses the C# programming language to solve sudoku puzzles. Weekend Project.

## Project Overview
The SudokuSolver project is designed to solve Sudoku puzzles of any difficulty level. The solver uses a backtracking algorithm to systematically try different numbers in each cell until a solution is found.

## How to use
To use the solver, simply download or clone the repository to your local machine and open the solution file in Visual Studio. 
The puzzle itself can be defined in `Program.cs' using a string array. You can enter the puzzle by filling in the numbers in a 9x9 grid, with empty cells represented by zeros. 
Build the solution and run the project. 
When the project is run, the solver will attempt a solution and display the solution on the console.

## Contribute
If you would like to contribute to the project, feel free to submit a pull request. I welcome any suggestions or improvements to the code.

Thanks for your interest in the SudokuSolver project!
